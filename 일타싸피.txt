Math.todegrees
Converts an angle measured in radians to an approximatelyequivalent angle measured in degrees. The conversion fromradians to degrees is generally inexact; users should not expect cos(toRadians(90.0)) to exactlyequal 0.0.Parameters:•angrad an angle, in radians
Returns:• the measurement of the angle angradin degrees.
Since:• 1.2

Math.pow
Math.sqrt
Math.atan
Returns the arc tangent of a value; the returned angle is in therange -pi/2 through pi/2. Special cases: •If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. 
•If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with thesame sign as the argument. 
•If the argument is infinite,then the result is the closest value to pi/2 with thesame sign as the input. 

The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.Results must be semi-monotonic.
Parameters:•a the value whose arc tangent is to be returned.
Returns:• the arc tangent of the argument.

Math.acos
Returns the arc cosine of a value; the returned angle is in therange 0.0 through pi. Special case: •If the argument is NaN or its absolute value is greaterthan 1, then the result is NaN. 
•If the argument is 1.0, the result is positive zero. 

The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.Results must be semi-monotonic.
Parameters:•a the value whose arc cosine is to be returned.
Returns:• the arc cosine of the argument.

Math.asin
Returns the arc sine of a value; the returned angle is in therange -pi/2 through pi/2. Special cases: •If the argument is NaN or its absolute value is greaterthan 1, then the result is NaN. 
•If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with thesame sign as the argument.

The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.Results must be semi-monotonic.
Parameters:•a the value whose arc sine is to be returned.
Returns:• the arc sine of the argument.
